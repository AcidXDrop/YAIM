# Yet Another Inventory Mod

---

YAIM is a simple mod that adds a chat command to allow you to resize your character's inventory from 2 up to 9999 slots, but be reasonable, adding a large number can affect your game's performance every time you open the inventory.

**Chat command:**
 * `/yaim [number]`
